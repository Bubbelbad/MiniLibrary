# MiniLibrary

This is a small version of a library. The goal of this project is to practice MySQL and database connection to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) within the database from the C# application. 

I wanted to practice CRUD, Views, Procedures, linked tables and making diagrams. There are a few saved in the repo. 

My first thought was that this would be a super small test program, so I did not bother with usercontrols or separating the code in as many classes as now would be convenient (it's a little bit messy).  






## Features

- Create user account to login with different grants
- Create, read, update and delete books from the database. 
- When you borrow a 'datetime' period of a month is created. 
- You can save books as favourites in a list
